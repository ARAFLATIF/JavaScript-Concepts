In JavaScript, the console, alert, and prompt are three distinct objects/methods that serve different purposes in interacting with the user or debugging the code.

Console Object
Purpose
The console object provides access to the browser's debugging console, allowing developers to log messages, errors, and other information for debugging purposes.


Methods
Here are some common methods of the console object:

console.log():
Logs a message to the console.

  console.log("Hello, World!");
console.log({ name: "John", age: 30 });
```[3][5][6].



console.error():
Logs an error message to the console, typically highlighted in red.

console.error("This is an error message.");
```[5][6].


console.warn():
Logs a warning message to the console, typically highlighted in yellow.  

  console.warn("This is a warning message.");
```[5][6].



console.clear():
Clears the console.

console.clear();
```[5][6].




  console.time() and console.timeEnd():
Starts and stops a timer to measure the execution time of a block of code.

  console.time("myTimer");
// some code here
console.timeEnd("myTimer");
```[5][6].



console.table():
Displays tabular data as a table.

console.table({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
```[5][6].




  console.count():
Logs the number of times this particular call to count() has been called.

  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.count();
}
```[5][6].



Usage
The console object is accessed directly or through the window.console property.


console.log("Message");
window.console.log("Message");
```[6].


  Alert Method
Purpose
The alert() method displays a dialog box with a specified message and an "OK" button. It is used to alert the user with some information.

Syntax
  alert(message);


EXAMPLE : 

alert("Hello, World!");

When alert() is called, the execution of the script is paused until the user clicks the "OK" button.



  Prompt Method
Purpose
The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user to input some text. It returns the input as a string.


  SYNTAX :

prompt(message, default);


EXAMPLE : 

let name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
console.log(name);




If the user clicks "OK" without entering any text, the default value is returned if provided; otherwise, an empty string is returned.
If the user clicks "Cancel", null is returned.





  Comparison and Usage
Console:
Used for debugging and logging messages to the console.
Does not interrupt the execution of the script.
Various methods for different types of logging (e.g., log, error, warn)356.
Alert:
Used to display a message to the user.
Interrupts the execution of the script until the user clicks "OK".
No input is taken from the user7.
Prompt:
Used to prompt the user for input.
Interrupts the execution of the script until the user clicks "OK" or "Cancel".
Returns the user's input as a string or null if canceled



A SUMMARY EXAMPLE : 

// Console usage
console.log("This is a log message.");
console.error("This is an error message.");
console.warn("This is a warning message.");

// Alert usage
alert("This is an alert message.");

// Prompt usage
let userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:", "John Doe");
console.log(userInput);




In summary, console is for debugging and logging, alert is for displaying messages to the user without taking input, and prompt is for taking input from the user. Each has its specific use case and impact on script execution.
