What are Arrays?
An array is a collection of elements of any data type (strings, numbers, booleans, objects) stored in a single variable.
Example:

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];


Creating Arrays
Array Literal:

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];


Array Constructor :

let colors = new Array("red", "green", "blue");


Accessing Elements
Elements are accessed using their index, which starts at 0.

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"

Array Length
The length property returns the number of elements in an array.

  let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits.length); // 3
