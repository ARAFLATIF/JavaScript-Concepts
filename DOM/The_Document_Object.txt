The Document object is the entry point to a web page's content. It's like the main door to the DOM structure. Through this object, you can:
Access elements on the page (e.g., find a specific paragraph or button)
Create new elements
Change page content
Modify page structure
Some common uses of the Document object include:
document.getElementById(): Find an element by its ID
document.createElement(): Create a new HTML element
document.querySelector(): Find elements using CSS selectors
Think of the Document object as a toolkit that gives you the power to manipulate everything on a web page programmatically.
In essence, the DOM provides the structure, and the Document object gives you the tools to work with that structure.
