Introducing the DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is like a tree-like structure that represents a web page. Imagine a web page as a family tree:
The entire document is the tree's root.
HTML elements (like <div>, <p>, <h1>) are branches or nodes.
Text inside elements are leaves.
This structure allows programmers to:
Access any part of the web page easily
Change content dynamically
Add or remove elements
Modify styles and attributes
It's essentially a way for programming languages (usually JavaScript) to interact with and manipulate web pages.
