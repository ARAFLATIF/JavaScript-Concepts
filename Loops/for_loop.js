What are For Loops?
A for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly for a specified number of iterations. It typically involves an initialization, a test expression, and an update of the loop variable.


  Example: Basic For Loop

for (let count = 0; count < 5; count++) {
    console.log(count);
}

Output :

0
1
2
3
4



More For Loops Examples
Counting up by one:

for (let count = 0; count <= 5; count++) {
    console.log(count);
}

Output :

0
1
2
3
4
5



Counting up in even numbers:

for (let count = 0; count <= 10; count += 2) {
    console.log(count);
}

Output : 

0
2
4
6
8
10
