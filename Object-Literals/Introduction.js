What are Object Literals?
An object literal is a way to create an object in JavaScript using a concise syntax. It is defined by a set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}.


const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, occupation: 'Developer' };


Key Features
Properties: Objects can have properties, which are key-value pairs.
Methods: Objects can also have methods, which are functions that belong to the object.

  const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Developer',
  greet: function() { console.log('Hello!'); }
};
