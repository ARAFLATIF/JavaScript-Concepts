Comparison operators in JavaScript are used to compare values and return a boolean result indicating whether the comparison is true or false. 
  Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the different comparison operators, their behaviors, and examples.


  Types of Comparison Operators
1. Equal To (==)
This operator checks if the values of the two operands are equal. It performs type coercion if the operands are of different types.

  console.log(5 == 5); // true
console.log(5 == '5'); // true
console.log(0 == false); // true
console.log(0 == null); // false[2][4][5]



2. Not Equal To (!=)
This operator checks if the values of the two operands are not equal. It also performs type coercion.


  console.log(5!= 6); // true
console.log(5!= '5'); // false
console.log(0!= false); // false
console.log(0!= null); // true[2][4][5]


3. Strict Equal To (===)
This operator checks if both the values and the types of the two operands are equal. It does not perform type coercion.


  console.log(5 === 5); // true
console.log(5 === '5'); // false
console.log(0 === false); // false
console.log(0 === null); // false[2][4][5]



4. Strict Not Equal To (!==)
This operator checks if the values or the types of the two operands are not equal. It does not perform type coercion.


  console.log(5!== 6); // true
console.log(5!== '5'); // true
console.log(0!== false); // true
console.log(0!== null); // true[2][4][5]



5. Greater Than (>)
This operator checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.


  console.log(3 > 2); // true
console.log('2' > '12'); // true (due to lexicographical ordering)[3][5]



6. Less Than (<)
This operator checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

console.log(2 < 3); // true
console.log('12' < '2'); // false (due to lexicographical ordering)[3][5]



7. Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
This operator checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right

console.log(3 >= 3); // true
console.log(2 >= 3); // false[3][5]




8. Less Than or Equal To (<=)
This operator checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

console.log(2 <= 3); // true
console.log(3 <= 2); // false[3][5]


Type Coercion
When comparing operands of different types, JavaScript often performs type coercion to make the comparison possible. For example:


console.log('5' == 5); // true (string '5' is coerced to number 5)
console.log(null == 0); // false (null is not coerced to 0 in equality checks)[2][4][5]



Strict Equality vs Loose Equality
Strict Equality (=== and !==): These operators do not perform type coercion and check both the value and the type of the operands.

  console.log('5' === 5); // false (string '5' is not equal to number 5)
console.log(null === 0); // false (null is not equal to 0)[2][4][5]



Loose Equality (== and !=): These operators perform type coercion to compare values.

console.log('5' == 5); // true (string '5' is coerced to number 5)
console.log(null == 0); // false (null is not coerced to 0 in equality checks)[2][4][5]




Examples and Usage
Here are some examples demonstrating the use of comparison operators in conditional statements:

let age = 25;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are old enough to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are too young to vote.");
}

let name = "John";
if (name === "John") {
  console.log("Hello, John!");
} else {
  console.log("Hello, stranger!");
}

let score = '10';
if (score == 10) {
  console.log("Your score is 10."); // true due to type coercion
} else {
  console.log("Your score is not 10.");
}

if (score === 10) {
  console.log("Your score is exactly 10."); // false because of different types
} else {
  console.log("Your score is not exactly 10.");
}
  


  Best Practices
Use Strict Equality: Prefer using === and !== to avoid unexpected results due to type coercion.
Type Conversion: Ensure that the operands are of the same type before comparison to avoid type coercion issues.
Readability: Use comparison operators in a way that makes your code readable and maintainable, especially in complex conditional statements.
