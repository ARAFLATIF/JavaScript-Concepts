Definition and Values
JavaScript Booleans are primitive data types that can only be one of two values: true or false.
  These values represent the truth value of a logical proposition


Usage
Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements (if...else, while loops), 
  logical operators (&&, ||, !), and comparison operators (==, !=, >, <)


  Truthy and Falsy Values
In JavaScript, values can be implicitly converted to Booleans in certain contexts. Here are the key conversions:
Truthy Values: Non-empty strings, numbers other than 0, objects, and arrays are considered true in a Boolean context.
Falsy Values: 0, NaN, empty strings, undefined, and null are considered false in a Boolean context



Boolean Conversion
You can explicitly convert values to Booleans using the Boolean() function or the double NOT operator (!!).



  const boolValue = Boolean(expression);
const boolValue2 =!!expression;
```[1][5].



Boolean Objects
While Booleans are typically used as primitive values, they can also be created as objects using the new Boolean() constructor.
However, this is not recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior and slower execution



EXAMPLE :

let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;

console.log(Boolean(10)); // true     
console.log(Boolean(0));  // false
console.log(Boolean("")); // false
console.log(Boolean(null)); // false

// detailed explanation : Hereâ€™s what happens in each case:
Boolean(10): The number 10 is converted to a Boolean. Since 10 is a non-zero number, it is considered a truthy value, so Boolean(10) returns true.
Boolean(0): The number 0 is converted to a Boolean. Since 0 is a falsy value, Boolean(0) returns false.
Boolean(""): An empty string is converted to a Boolean. Since an empty string is a falsy value, Boolean("") returns false.
Boolean(null): The value null is converted to a Boolean. Since null is a falsy value, Boolean(null) returns false.

if (isTrue) {
  console.log("This will be executed");
}

if (!isFalse) {
  console.log("This will also be executed");
}



Best Practices
Use true and false as primitive values.
Avoid using the Boolean constructor with new.
Use implicit Boolean conversions in conditional statements for clarity and simplicity
